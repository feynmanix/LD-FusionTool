{"name":"CR-Batch","tagline":"Standalone RDF data fusion tool based on ODCleanStore Conflict Resolution","body":"# cr-batch\r\n\r\nCR-Batch is a standalone tool for execution of data fusion and conflict resolution on RDF data accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. CR-Batch is based on the conflict resolution component implemented in [ODCleanStore](https://sourceforge.net/p/odcleanstore/wiki/Home/), a Linked Data management tool.\r\n\r\nCurrently, CR-Batch works only with data processed by ODCleanStore. In order to use it, one should deploy ODCleanStore and then run CR-Batch on the clean database instance of ODCleanStore. Please refer to ODCleanStore [User Manual](http://sourceforge.net/projects/odcleanstore/files/odcleanstore/0.3/ODCleanStore%20User%20Manual.pdf/download) for more information about ODCleanStore and general information about the conflict resolution executed by CR-Batch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
