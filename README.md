CR-Batch
========

CR-Batch is a standalone tool for execution of data fusion and conflict resolution on RDF data accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. CR-Batch is based on the conflict resolution component implemented in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/odcleanstore/wiki/Home/">ODCleanStore</a>, a Linked Data management tool.

Currently, CR-Batch works only with data processed by ODCleanStore. In order to use it, one should deploy ODCleanStore and then run CR-Batch on the clean database instance of ODCleanStore. Please refer to ODCleanStore <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/odcleanstore/files/odcleanstore/0.3/ODCleanStore%20User%20Manual.pdf/download">User Manual</a> for more information about ODCleanStore and general information about the conflict resolution executed by CR-Batch.
