LD-FusionTool
========

LD-FusionTool is a standalone tool for execution of data fusion and conflict resolution on RDF data from various sources.

In order to use LD-FusionTool, download the sources, build them with Maven and execute<br/> <code>java -jar odcsft-application-&lt;version&gt;-executable.jar &lt;configuration-file&gt;.xml</code>. Running the executable without parameters shows more usage options and sample configuration files can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mifeet/LD-FusionTool/tree/master/examples">examples</a> (file <code>sample-config-full.xml</code> serves as the working documentation of the configuration file).


Originally based on the conflict resolution component in a Linked Data management tool <a href="https://github.com/ODCleanStore/ODCleanStore">ODCleanStore</a>, LD-FusionTool is now being implemented as a data processing unit in its successor <a href="https://github.com/UnifiedViews">UnifiedViews</a>.
